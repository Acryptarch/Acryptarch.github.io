# Intro

I'm a student at Rutgers. Yay!

# Currently

Looking for Summer and Fall internships. Tryning learn some backend stuff to broaden my horizons. Machine learning and data processing would also be very cool.


# Travel / Geography

- I've only ever been in two countries other than good ol USA and they are Canada and India. I really got to get out of this country more. Maybe I'll visit Greece. Seems like a pretty chill place.

# Fun facts

- I just started watching Cobra Kai. I've literally never seen a show with such terrible writing that I keep coming back to
- I spend too much time on TikTok

# I dream of

- Understanding code I've written a year ago
- To be blessed by documentaion wherever I go
- Mastering CSS
